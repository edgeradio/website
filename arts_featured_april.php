              <div class="newstext">
              <p>As part of Ten Days on the Island, Matt Coyle is exhibiting prints from his book “Worry Doll” at the historic hospital for the insane at Willow Court in New Norfolk. He invites you to experience his work in a unique walk-through installation on the walls of this historic lunatic asylum. </p>
              <p><em>Worry Doll</em> is a dark and frightening story about three toys that are witness to the gruesome murder of their host family. They flee the crime tripping from one place to the next in a misfortunate journey through a nightmare dream carrying with them the weight of their worries.</p>
              <p>“Do you think I have a problem? I mean, I know I’m a little introverted but it’s not like it’s anything major. Sometimes though - and you’ll be pleased to know this isn’t one of those times - I get a real urge to lash out and punch the person I am talking to. It’s like they’re talking to me and all I can think of is what’s holding me back? Everyone gets a bit like that though, don’t you think.”<br />
                (Exert from Matt Coyle’s book <em>Worry Doll</em>)</p>
              <p>His book is creepy, but put it in the historic insane asylum and then you have nightmare material. Willow Court is a perfect place to house the work of Matt Coyle.</p>
              <p>“Willow Court has a strong and at times terrible history, there is alot of power in the place,” says Matt.<br />
                To be honest I was a bit apprehensive about doing an interview with an obsessive compulsive artist who works only with black felt tip pens, spending up to seventy hours making photo realistic drawings of murder scenes, deranged dolls and unsettling horror.<br />
                However I was greeted with smiles and the smell of hot cup cakes cooking, from his family. I scanned the house for traps.</p>
              <p>His studio is modest and small and like most artists studios, organised chaos. Props for his graphic novels lay on the ground, dismantled dolls, stuffed toys, stacks of books and boxes upon boxes of black felt tip pens. <br />
                “I strictly work in black pen…. It’s the love of the craft of drawing the love of the process…. I come more from a painting background, my interest in doing graphic work is based on combining a sequence of individual drawings,” he says.<br />
                These intricate, methodical and remarkable drawings are created late at night after his family goes to bed, the coffee pot goes on, death metal plays, and so does his wild and chilling imagination.</p>
              <p>WORRY DOLL @ WILLOW COURT is a part of Ten Days on the Island, and is a free event on at Willow Court, New Norfolk till April 12th, 10am – 4pm daily. </p>

              <p>It’s not every day you meet someone who has run away to join the&nbsp;circus, travelled the world in search of treasure and is responsible for shaking Tasmania up every two years with the international art event Ten Days On The Island.</p>
              <p>Arts on the Edge spoke with Elizabeth Walsh the Artistic Director of Ten Days On The Island, about what it is like, juggling Tasmania's renowned biennial arts festival, and what treasures she has found from Aotearoa/New Zealand, Iceland, Taiwan, England, Scotland and of course Tasmania.</p>
              <p>Ten Days on the Island is an extravaganza of music, performance, and my favourite the visual arts.&nbsp; Tasmania is saturated with art from all around Australia and the world. You’ll trip over it as it spills into the streets and this year into more obscure places, like Willow Court in New Norfolk, the first ‘insane asylums’ that operated as part of the Royal Derwent Psychiatric Hospital until 2000, chosen for Matt Coyle’s installation “Worry doll”. As well as works by well known artists in five heritage homes around Tasmania&nbsp;as a part of the exhibition “Trust”.</p>
              <p>“Trust is a project that has taken six years to evolve. It is the result of the partnership between the national trust of Australia, The University of Tasmanian School of Art and Ten Days On The Island. It grew out of a project in 2007 called the Port Arthur project.”</p>
              <p>“ I am very interested that as a place we hold some of the nation’s most significant built heritage and how contemporary we as Tasmanians vision that”, says Walsh.</p>
              <p>If there is one thing you need in the arts industry it is passion, and Elizabeth Welsh is a whirlwind of it, you can’t help but get swept up in her enthusiasm. &nbsp;She runs at a million miles an hour, never stopping, but always smelling the roses. &nbsp;</p>
              <p>“It’s been fantastic, I’ve always followed my heart in terms of what I’ve wanted to engage with culturally.” She says.</p>
              <p>She has been artistic director for Ten Days since 2001, and has watched the event grow and evolve. Don’t ask her what her favourite event is for 2009, she loves all of them like children, all unique and beautiful in their own way. </p>
              <p>“There are things I get excited about for different reasons.” She says.</p>
              <p>Elizabeth has reasons to get excited, this year 2009 Ten Days of the Island will blow you away, for more information pick up a blue program guide from any gallery, TMAG or good café, or simply go to www.tendaysontheisland.org</p>
              <p>Better still listen to Arts on the Edge every Sunday between 4-6pm and we’ll tell you what’s going on.</p>
