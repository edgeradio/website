              </div>
              <div class="newstext">
              <p>It’s pouring down with rain as I meet Judith Abell on the corner of the street near her studio. Her studio is located in one of these amazing places that are tucked up in the rabbit warrens of old Hobart buildings. We climb the narrow stairs, with warped walls and series of doors, to finally make it to her studio… I find myself short of breath.</p>
              <p>Judith is out of breath as well, but it’s not from climbing those stairs - she has been racing around all day, flat out with back to back meetings, stopping off quickly along the way to do the compulsory hunting and gathering around the local tip shops to pick up her materials. </p>
              <p>She opens the door to her modest studio and as I enter I trip over something that looks like a TV aerial. I apologise profusely as I try to untangle myself without breaking everything, or cause some sort of avalanche. She lets me know she cleaned up for me. I laugh nervously. Judith’s studio is packed to the brim, a jungle of fantastic materials and objects that have been salvaged from the tip shop, or somewhere along the way.</p>
              <p>“There is so much martial out there it really bothers me to buy new. I do a tour of duty of the tip shop on a really regular basis, probably every two weeks I go to at least two of them. For years I have had this fascination with the whole concept of the junk shop. I guess, you never know what you’re going to find and there is always some kind of treasure…there is that classic statement that one persons trash is another’s treasure, it’s exciting every time I go,” says Judith.</p>
              <p>I compose myself, take a deep breath, and press the record button, armed with questions. “So Judith how would you describe your work?” I ask. &nbsp;She looks and smiles. She seems familiar with the generic art questions. </p>
              <p>“I have a complete fascination with materials. I don’t think it necessarily matters what the materials are although I think I prefer the ordinary, the normally unseen, the stuff that passes most people by. Just looking around here, I have Venetian blinds, old shop shelfing, I have an obsession in collecting,” she explains.</p>
              <p>Judith Abell is not only a Sculptor but an Architect, Designer, and a freelance arts writer for well known art and design magazines. </p>
              <p>“It’s busy, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. My work in architecture is really busy, stressful, and full on every day so doing the art stuff really helps it…now people are saying ‘hey Jude would you come and talk to us about this because we really like the fact your doing design and art’…What happens with my sculpture practice from my architecture experience is there is an understanding of how materials go together. The project management you need in architecture really helps for getting art projects done”.</p>
              <p>Judith has gained so much knowledge and skill from working across all these disciplines, she tells me she feels as if she has an unfair advantage, however after working hard for ten years I think she deserves it.&nbsp; Her years of experience in architecture, design and writing blended with her strong sense of aesthetics and materials have helped her secure public art commissions, fellowships, residencies and this year the Moorilla scholarship for 2010. </p>
              <p>“With things like Moorilla I didn’t think I had very much chance of winning it…. I saw a Moorilla exhibition in my first year and I remember getting excited about what could be possible with the money from that, I thought wow, wouldn’t it be great to win that”. </p>
              <p>As I look around her studio I can see her sculptures resting, quietly waiting until they are completed. All Judith’s sculptural pieces are mainly made from recycled and salvaged materials. </p>
              <p>“I would like to think I’m green in my thinking but we are all hypocrites when it comes down to it,” she says laughing. </p>
              <p>Judith’s refined finishes and attention to detail create beautiful organic works that transcend the material’s previous life. Her sense of aesthetics is tightly in tune with the material she is using, always allowing the material to guide the making of the work. </p>
              <p>What I find most appealing about Judith’s work is they way she marries her materials with space. Each sculpture responds and relates to the area it inhabits. Like a living plant her work seems to breathe, move, and respond, creating shadows, reflecting light or fluttering with the wind. Her works are never just plonked in a space, rather they are carefully considered within the sensibility and understanding of place. </p>
              <p>This intimate understating of material and space allows Judith to create works that are both gentle and powerful. </p>
              <p>“I’m only just beginning to hit my stride in terms of being an architect, I’m only just beginning to get somewhere in terms of being an artist. I really like thinking about how those things can come together.”</p>
              <p>I press stop on the recorder; we have been talking for more than half an hour,&nbsp;&nbsp; it’s now dark outside. I don’t mind though, and neither does she. I finish by saying that I can’t wait to see what she makes for the 2010 Moorilla exhibition, laughing, she replies, “Neither can I.”            </p>

              </div>
              <div class="newstext">
              <p>Why does an artist need to know about business? Why can’t we just make art?</p>
              <p>For I long while I thought business was a dirty word. Why as an artist would I need to know anything about that nasty, dog eat dog world? I just want to make art, and for people to buy it, so I can keep making art, and perhaps even feed myself. </p>
              <p>Simple, right? Well not quite. Before long I was dealing with galleries, shops, invoice systems, commissions, tax, supplies, networking (sorry that’s a filthy word as well, let’s say ‘meeting people and swapping details and ideas’), so with that came business cards, web sites, grants and so much more so essentially, I was running my own business, and yes, I have to admit it was a shambles. That’s when I decided that I needed help (no, not psychiatric). Business advice. </p>
              <p>I didn’t do the Lucrative Arts Business (LAB) Course, that is tailored to artist’s needs, but after speaking with Carolyn Coates the Project Manager and Kristen Molhuysen the Project Manager of LabChat, I wish I did. </p>
              <p>LAB is a major project of Salamanca Arts Centre and is situated on the second floor in this lively arts hive.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>“LAB was set up in response to artists either avoiding or struggling with the business component of their practice…we felt the need for a program that worked with artists over an extended period of time, in a more flexible method of delivery,” Carolyn explains.</p>
              <p>I was relived to hear that the scheme is not just about writing a business plan, it is about creating workshops and other activities around individuals and their needs. </p>
              <p>“We have a series of workshops which essentially follow a business planning process but within that we work with the artist, we ask them what their problem areas are and what they are struggling with and what they would like to know about, so the workshops are manipulated to meet the needs of the artists,” she says. </p>
              <p>Right about now you’re probably thinking this article is bit cash for comment, but they are not paying me for a start, so that kind of defeats that. In fact I write these articles because I care about what’s going on in the arts.</p>
              <p>Its pays to be business savvy in these uncertain times. The global financial crisis (GFC) has already reduced the state’s income by $1 million dollars. </p>
              <p>The government has already rearranged the arts, reducing its funding. This overhaul of the arts is drying up grants, opportunities, and in some cases assistance to artists that have been running for years. </p>
              <p>If you have picked up the new Arts Tasmania grants handbook you might have noticed some changes ‘to ensure the development of high quality applications’. The implications of this will require artists to have a full understanding of their business practices and procedures and in some cases, a full business plan is needed when applying for grants or other opportunities.</p>
              <p>Because of this current climate it is apparent that the Lucrative Arts Business program is even more appropriate. This course will give you the skills to know how to approach your work in a professional, educated and confident way. They really seem to understand what artists want and how to make business matters accessible. But most of all they care about getting artists on their feet and on their way to being successful. </p>
              <p>“We care and become interested in every one of our client’s business aspirations, so do our consultants, and so do all the other artists in the group...It brings business conversation into the creative persons life,” Carolyn says.</p>
              <p>Kristen Molhuysen the Project Manager of LabChat, has just started a new initiative that is all about conversation. In collaboration with LAB, this new program aims to bring guest speakers to talk about business topics relevant to creative people. </p>
              <p>Kirsten explains to me that LabChat will extend networks for artists within Hobart with other artists and professionals within the industry, thus extending the networks that already exist. The LabChat concept will create opportunities for people to get together and discuss issues that are of interest and relevance to creative peoples arts business and practice. </p>
              <p>The Lab participants have an opportunity to have conversations with successful artists and business people, sharing concerns and ideas about business topics relevant to creative people.</p>
              <p>“There are so many inspiring stories out there, I started to think, how can we get these inspiring positive people in, who have already faced certain challenges” Kristen says enthusiastically.</p>
              <p>LAB is not just about writing a business plan, or being squeezed through a program for profit. LAB is about giving artists the tools they need to succeed, meeting other artists, and creating ideas in a flexible and supportive environment. The workshops for 2009 have already commenced, however they tell me I can go in at any time and get help as an individual.              </p>
              <p>“They can access us as mentors any time...A lot of the time when you’re in a small business, it can be fairly isolating, the decision can all lay squarely on your shoulders. It can be great to come in and talk to someone and just have someone listen who is genuinely interested and can point you in the right direction or connect you with other people who can support them through that process” Caroyln reassures me.</p>
              <p>For years I have struggled through my practice, finding things out the hard way. But it doesn’t have to be hard when people like Carolyn Coates and Kristen Molhuysen are there to help you.</p>
To find out for yourself, why not pop in and see them at the Salamanca Arts Centre, on the second floor or listen to the Arts on Edge podcast with Carolyn Coates the Project Manager and Kristen Molhuysen the Project Manager of LabChat on the featured artists page for more details.            </div></td>
