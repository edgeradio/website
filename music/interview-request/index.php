  <h1 class="title-head-right">Interview Requests</h1>
All interview requests are handled by the Programming Department. Edge Radio loves great music interviews, but due to huge demand, we can only place a fraction of the interview requests we get. For all interview requests please email <b>interviews [at] edgeradio.org.au</b>. Your request will be sent directly to our Interviews Coordinator. Every interview request will be considered but the final decision is always up to individual programs.
<br><br>
If you would prefer an interview be scheduled during a particular program please check the program guide before contacting the station to make sure the interview is relevant to the show and include that information in your email.
<br><br>
Please note that we're always happy to receive your new releases and learn of upcoming gigs to promote, but the Interviews Coordinator will not respond to anything other than interview requests. If you are submitting music for airplay or requesting feedback please visit music submission page <a href="http://www.edgeradio.org.au/music/submit-music/">here</a>. Likewise the Music Department will not respond to interview requests.
