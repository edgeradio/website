        <p class="text">Volunteers are what gives this station the Edge. They contribute to the station in a number of ways but primarily as on air producers and presenters. It takes a lot of volunteers to keep Edge Radio on-air 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We aim to bring new people to the station who are committed to the stationâ€™s philosophical objectives and want to contribute to station life.</p>
        <h1 class="greyheader">How to get involved</h1>
        <p class="text">Edge Radio is always looking for fresh talent! Listen to Edge Radio NOW and work out what YOU think Edge Radio needs!</p>

<p class="text"><b>APPLICATIONS NOW OPEN FOR SUMMER SCHEDULE - APPLICATIONS CLOSE FRIDAY OCT 14.</b></p>

<p class="text">On-Air: Edge Radio has 2 x 6 month programming periods throughout the year (June-Nov/Dec-May)....but</p>

<p class="text">Occasionally space will open up for new programs or to host a current show. If you fancy yourself as a presenter let us know. As you'll quickly find, previous experience is not necessary you just need the enthusiasm and a spare hour or two each week to do your show.</p>

<p class="text">Before applying for a program please consider the following:</p>

<p class="text">Our programming is made up of two categories -</p>

<p class="text"><b>Specialist Music: </b>From 6pm onwards weekdays and variable on weekends. These programs are generally based on music genres ie funk, hard rock, metal, drum n bass, and rely on the presenter's knowledge of their chosen genre and large CD/vinyl collection.</p>

<p class="text"><b>General Talk: </b>7am - 6pm weekdays and variable on weekends. These programs are based on focused talk content ie current affairs, queer culture, film reviews, anime, the paranormal. These programs do not specialise in music and therefore use the Edge Radio music catalogue. Our breakfast and lunch time shows also fit into this category and are a great way to learn basic radio presentation skills without having to have a super duper idea for a show.</p>

<p class="text">If you don't have a great idea, but would like to learn radio skills - why not apply for one of our morning 'magazine' style slots or a lunch slot?</p>

<p class="text">Please note: If your program application is approved, all new presenters must go through our Basic Radio Training Course. To book your place, email training@edgeradio.org.au. The next training course is scheduled to take place in November 2011. Dates listed below.</p>

<p class="text">Program application forms can downloaded from the links to the left.</p>

<p class="text">Content: We are always looking out for program content. This could be in the form of an interview/feature/documentary - whatever. Tell us what your story ideas are - if it's good it may end up on air.</p>

<p class="text">Non broadcast: There are many ways you can help out the station from general administrative duties to helping on the web site or music library - you could assist in organising a fundraiser, technical assistance, marketing and promotions. Whatever your skill or expertise is - we may be able to use it.</p>

<p class="text">What to do: Send in a outline telling us about yourself - your skills, interests, media or community experience, why you want to be a volunteer at Edge Radio and what you would like to do.</p>
